# Clean Up Meeting Notes

Take the specified meeting notes file and clean it up according to these guidelines:

## Cleaning Process:
1. Remove filler words, redundant phrases, and unnecessary repetition
2. Consolidate similar points into single, clear statements
3. Organize information into logical sections
4. Preserve all key decisions, action items, and important details
5. **Preserve all existing [[]] Obsidian links** from the original content
6. Maintain the original meaning while improving clarity and readability

## Output Format:
- Meeting title and date at the top (use # header)
- Attendees list (if available) (use ## header)
- Key discussion points organized by topic (use ## headers for topics)
- Clear action items with assigned owners and deadlines
- Important decisions highlighted with **bold** text or > blockquotes
- Next steps clearly outlined (use ## header)
- Preserve all [[]] Obsidian links and references

## Style Guidelines:
- Output in clean, Obsidian-compatible Markdown
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
- Keep sentences concise but complete
- Use active voice where possible
- **Preserve all existing [[]] links** and create new ones for important references
- Remove verbal fillers and tangential discussions
- Preserve technical terms and specific details
- Maintain chronological flow when relevant
- Use proper Markdown headers (##, ###) for section organization
